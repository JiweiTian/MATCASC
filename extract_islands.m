function mpck = extract_islands(mpc, groups, k)
%EXTRACT_ISLANDS Extracts each island in a network with islands
%   MPC_ARRAY = EXTRACT_ISLANDS(MPC)
%   MPC_ARRAY = EXTRACT_ISLANDS(MPC, GROUPS)
%   MPC_K = EXTRACT_ISLANDS(MPC, K)
%   MPC_K = EXTRACT_ISLANDS(MPC, GROUPS, K)
%
%   Returns a cell array of MATPOWER case structs for each island in
%   the input case struct. If the optional second argument is a cell
%   array GROUPS it is assumed to be a cell array of vectors of bus
%   indices for each island (as returned by FIND_ISLANDS). Providing
%   the GROUPS avoids the need for another traversal of the network
%   connectivity and can save a significant amount of time on very
%   large systems. If an additional scalar argument K is included, it
%   indicates which island to return and the return value is the single
%   corresponding case struct itself.
%
%   See also FIND_ISLANDS, CONNECTED_COMPONENTS.
